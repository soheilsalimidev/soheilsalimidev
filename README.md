**Warning: Code Ahead!**

Hi, I'm Soheil - a Rust-ace, TypeScript wizard, and AI enthusiast (read: nerd) studying by day and freelancing by night. When I'm not busy saving the world one line of code at a time, you can find me exploring the depths of GitHub, searching for the perfect emoji to use in my commit messages ðŸ¤£.

**About my coding style:**

* I'm a Rust fanatic, which means I'm obsessed with memory safety and performance. Don't @ me.
* TypeScript is my go-to for when I need to write JavaScript, but still want to keep my sanity.
* AI is my new favorite toy - I love experimenting with machine learning models and seeing what kind of chaos I can create.

**About my life:**

* By day, I'm a student, trying to learn as much as I can about computer science and software engineering.
* By night, I'm a freelancer, building projects for clients and trying to make a name for myself in the industry.

**Get in touch:**

If you want to chat about Rust, TypeScript, AI, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out! You can find me on [Telegram](https://t.me/soheilsalimidev).

That's me in a nutshell! Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find my code entertaining (or at least, not too boring ðŸ˜´).
